### I'll be working on an update over the 2020 christmas peroid. I'll try to add Steven Universe Future
# Steven Universe - title card generator!
This is a fork of a Steven Universe title card generator; You can find it [Here](https://github.com/SpopovabgS/SU-titlecard-generator) it was made by [SpopovabgS](https://github.com/SpopovabgS)
## How does this work?
From looking through it; this project is built from HTML, JavaScript and CSS and uses V5 of the [Crewniverse](https://www.deviantart.com/maxigamer/art/Crewniverse-Font-V-5-MORE-ACCENTS-AND-SYMBOLS-540122768) font made by [MaxiGamer](https://www.deviantart.com/maxigamer) on DeviantArt.
## What does it work on?
SpopovabgS only tested it on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox and I've tested it on the current version of  
Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Edge Chromium.  
(It will work on any browser that supports "Right Click --> Save as" on an image!  
  Tested on 10/10/2019 (DD/MM/YYYY) and Windows 10 1909)
